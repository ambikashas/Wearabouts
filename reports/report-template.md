# YYYYMMDD Report
## Team Report
### Last week's goals
- an exact copy of the third section from last week
### Progress and issues
- what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
### Plans and goals for the next week
- each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate.

    - You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task.

- If tasks from one week ago aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with a brief statement about struggles or blockers, and an updated estimate for time to completion.

- For individual team members, no bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days. If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress.

- For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.
