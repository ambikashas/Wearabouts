###Team Report

Last Week's Goals

- Have a solid random oufit generator algo ready for Beta presentation to simulate end goal.
- Enable users to manually edit and save tags for simulation of end goal -- to get accurate results.
- Work on getting the backend --> in specific the Supabase ready
- Connect the backend image-tagging pipeline to the frontend UI for a smooth tagging and outfit creation flow.
  
Progress and Issues

  - Started integrating Google Vision AI for automated image tagging.
  - Manual tag editing updates persist correctly in the backend.
  - Main AI outfit creation algorithm partially implemented and functional.
  - “Create Outfit” page interactive and responsive, supporting drag-and-drop or tap-to-select.
  - Started working on basics for strech goal Weather feature!!!

Plans and Goals for the Next Week

- Continue Google Vision integration and test automated tagging -- also make sure google vision is working properly (with image quality)
- Implement the main AI algorithm for outfit creation in tandem with backend database.
- Have the AI outfit generation portion significantly developed 
- Support initial integration of AI outfit generation with frontend UI.

### Progress and issues
- what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
- Ambika
    - Worked on Beta release presentation
    - Looking into Google Vision AI integration for tag generation
    - Looked into Supabase Edge Functions and Secrets
    - Developed AI tag generation for images that are uploaded
    - Fixed uploaded image file type conversion issue (e.g., from heic to jpeg)

- Amy
    - Beta release presentation
    - Outfit view for randomly generated updates
    - Some issues regarding tests and how to test API calls
    - Bug fixes (confetti cannon + back button functionality)

- Emily
    - Connected the database (Supabase) to our project and worked on image upload function to the database.
    - Set up the database tables and item parameters.
    - Add delete button for clothing items and item info screen.
    - Added a dropbox for type, manual image names/tags for clothing image upload, and fixed tests in add-clothes for the beta release

- Laura
   - Refactored the app to fetch and display real data from the database instead of using mock data.
   - Updated data handling to support dynamic loading and prevent rendering issues.
   - Fixed warnings and errors in tests related to component updates and unmounting.
   - Improved image handling and test coverage to match the new data flow.


- Nina
    - Added random outfit generation algorithm for beta release
    - Beta release preparation and presentation 
    - Added and fully implemented the AI outfit generation feature
        - Supabase Edge Functions
        - Google Gemini model & prompting
        - Reorganized some files after implementing the backend index for the feature
        - AI generates outfit name suggestion, but the user can edit before saving
        - Debugging/resolving issues: avoid immediately saving after generation, i.e., avoid duplicate saved outfits
    - Updated related tests
    - Updated UI to return/reload to homescreen after user saves the generated outfit
    - Helped address issues with Ambika regarding the AI tagging feature 

- Priyanka
    - Did the beta release presentation
    - Got presentation ready by creating scripts 
    - refined the UI for beta presentation and created slides for presentation
    - updated the readme to accurately reflect the projects current state
    - planned with team beta random outfit generator algo for time being
    - Game planned with team to learn about how Supabase ties in backend and dicuss future steps for it

   
### Plans and goals for the next week
- Ambika
    - Researching and testing out different factors that impact the quality and number of tags generated by Google Vision (2 days)
    - Discussing any other improvements for AI generation with team (1 day)
    - Working on implementing fixes based on research/test results to further improve the quality and number of tags generated (2 days)
    - Integrating Google Vision label generation for the weather_tags column in our database as well so that we can later also provide outfit suggestions based on weather (1 day)
 
- Amy
    - Furthering research regarding AI tagging + outfit creation (1 day)
    - Discussion LLM model pros/cons with team (1 day)
    - Further implement fixes and stretch goals as discussed with team (2 days)
    - Test and verify AI features (1 day)

- Emily
    - Doing research on the AI tagging and also outfit making algorithm in order to understand how the AI is making these decisions and possibly improve it based on feeding it more information. Also discuss this with the team and how to implement the weather AI features. (1 day)
    - Implement a search bar in the closet to allow users to search for items in the database/their closet by name and/or tags. (2 days)
    - Work on users being able to manually edit their tags on clothing on the clothing info screen. (1 day)
    - Help with weather AI related features for the stretch goal implementation. (1 day)

- Laura
   - Doing research and fixing the “force rendering” when adding items/outfits to the closet (3 days)
   - Help implement the search bar to look by tags with Emily (2 days)
   - Refactor the UI to make it a bit more clean and practical (e.g. move outfit to separate tabs)s (2 days)


- Nina
    - Discuss with the whole team about the two added AI features, questions, concerns, feedback, etc. (1 day)
    - Discuss with the team the remaining schedule, refining UI, addressing issues, adding more backend testing, and implementing stretch goals (weather, account creation/sign in). (2 days)
    - Refine UI, specifically update the success confetti state to be consistent across pages (1 day)
    - Possibly refine AI prompting for outfit generation, if there is feedback from the team (1 day)
    - Work on backend-related issues and suggestions as per team feedback (2 days)

- Priyanka
    - Research AI-driven approaches to enhance the current outfit algorithm, moving beyond the existing randomness-based method (1 day)
    -Evaluate and select appropriate LLMs for AI integration within the algorithm, considering pros/cons and performance implications (1 day)
    -Collaborate with the team to discuss AI algorithm design, possible       improvements, and integration strategies (1 day)
    - Explore how the weather-based stretch goal could be incorporated into AI outfit generation, including potential tagging and decision-making logic (2 days)
    - Develop and implement starter code to prepare for future AI integration, ensuring modularity and easy handoff to team members (1 day)
   - Assist with testing and verifying AI features once integrated, providing feedback on outputs and suggesting refinements (1 day)
